The TeensyMIDI uses three 16pin multiplexers (MUX).

MUX1 deals with the 2 effect channels (each with 4 Knobs and 4 buttons)

MUX2 deals with the LOW/MID/HIGH mixer section and the HIGH-/LOW-pass filter

MUX3 deals with the "button section" of deck 1/3 and the "volume section" (in total 4 sliders and 12 buttons)
