# DIY-MIDI-controller
As I am switching from Traktor Pro to Mixxx, I took the chance and rewrote the code of my 4-Deck Teensy MIDI controller.

## Specs of the controller
- 4 Deck Mixer
- 2 Decks for scratching, each having a shift key
- 2 effect chains

## TODO
- Implement track selection knob and buttons
- Fix the loop size selection
- Add the LED blinking support
- Test the configuration and search for bugs (there are certainly many of them!!)
